# 🧠 Modular AI Crypto Trading Bot

A real-time, extensible AI-driven crypto trading bot built in Python.  
The system integrates market data (via **CCXT**), technical indicators, RAG-based news summarization, and an advanced multi-agent decision engine powered by **three cooperating LLMs**.  
These models analyse market conditions, debate trading scenarios, and converge on a structured JSON action: **buy / sell / hold / pass**.

## Key Features

- **Real-time trading + simulation-ready architecture**  
- **Plugin-friendly system** for indicators, news sources, and strategies  
- **Multi-LLM discussion-based decision making**  
- **RAG-backed news deduplication and summarization**  
- **SQLite trade history and structured logging**  
- **Clean, modular Python design**  

> Ideal for education, experimentation, and proof-of-concept AI trading research.
